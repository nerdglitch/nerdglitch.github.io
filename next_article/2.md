# EA fa un miliardo di dollari su Fifa!

ladies and gentlemen hello and welcome
00:01
to the annual general meeting for laymen
00:03
gaming we worked very hard here to
00:06
defeat EA and reduce its revenues in
00:10
micro transactions and after two and a
00:12
half years of work I'm sure we've
00:13
achieved great success Sam tell me
00:15
what's what are the numbers like
00:17
certainly have let's have a look at them
00:21
EA made 1 billion of micro transactions
00:25
just the last quarter alone so at least
00:30
it's not a million and one leyland save
00:38
gaming we stopped EA for making a
00:41
billion and $1 that's good so you're
00:43
welcome
00:44
reddit's you're welcome how it feels to
00:47
chew 5 come guys layman we fought the
00:55
good fight against EA we really started
00:59
our channel 2017 actually it was Oliver
01:01
da okay June 2017 after we got back from
01:03
e3 being your cameraman got it sucked
01:07
anyway it was still good followed you I
01:09
you are still my camera oh yeah still
01:10
we're still having fun to this day okay
01:12
we started with EA and now we are back
01:14
talking about here that's right because
01:16
what they've done recently is an
01:17
earnings call where they talk about how
01:18
much money they've made and they made a
01:22
lot of money from micro transactions 1
01:23
billion dollars from micro transactions
01:25
last quarter alone and they also talked
01:27
about the future of EA as a company what
01:30
they're working on next stuff they do
01:32
with Nintendo a Nintendo switch stuff
01:34
for next gen their future of life
01:36
services they're actually quite a bit
01:38
here some of it is kind of good news to
01:40
be honest with you some of it is VA
01:42
gonna be a sabbatical
01:44
[Music]
01:49
so guys again this channel was built on
01:52
the motto EA bad okay quick fatal so
01:55
let's roll some old footage
01:57
hello fam I'm layman and this is gaming
02:00
don't call them fam trauma thing
02:01
cofferdam is so done right now it's so
02:03
finished okay look how much Sam has
02:06
changed /a age in that time this way
02:09
that's what happen to a blink and
02:10
everybody if you look at photos of him
02:12
okay he's for the wedding of the world
02:14
his shoulders say to me but I wasn't
02:16
that the very first I was Belle Epoque
02:17
video we do has the worst life ratio
02:19
because it was before everyone realized
02:21
it was garbage
02:22
so obviously EA has had a very rocky
02:24
past it had Star Wars Battlefront 2
02:25
being one of the biggest launches asses
02:28
in video game history culminating in the
02:30
most downloaded reddit post in history
02:31
that wonderful pride and accomplishment
02:33
war that was better for us to of cuddles
02:35
the does loot yeah stuff with loot boxes
02:37
and actually tribute triggered a global
02:39
sort of like government push back
02:42
against loot boxes which still continues
02:43
to this day by the way you had the
02:45
disastrous battlefield 5 launch both in
02:47
terms of like the tone of the game the
02:49
way they engage their audiences and all
02:50
the bugs in the game that actually
02:52
persists to this day by the way yeah and
02:54
then of course you had stuff like the
02:56
cancellation of project ragtag that star
02:58
would all be with Amy Hennig you had
02:59
closure of studios you had like the
03:01
death of single-player games really how
03:03
EA once declared that the market really
03:05
was is interested in single-player game
03:07
right they were stuck to their guns okay
03:11
they do not come out with another game
03:12
out of the out of the ruins of ragtag so
03:15
so basically
03:16
TLDR EA shit tier company for a long
03:20
last time what's changed though with EA
03:22
because there has actually been some
03:24
changes yes there has
03:25
okay so let's start with Apex legends
03:27
are absolutely no marketing comes out of
03:29
nowhere
03:30
made by respawn jumps on the scene it is
03:33
a battle royale and it's actually really
03:36
bloody good it is a and it actually gets
03:38
a bit of a following pretty quickly and
03:41
it's still pretty you know important to
03:44
this day stars it's a fortnight big but
03:46
it definitely made a dent on the battle
03:47
royale mark that's a launch season for
03:49
as well it's got really momentum in
03:51
season three had more engagement in
03:53
season two according to EA three numbers
03:54
and they're about well the star working
03:56
on a mobile version of the game which
03:58
will surely go Ganga
03:59
and I'm gonna be really good with no
04:00
microtransactions in of course but for
04:02
now look that has been pretty well
04:03
received then we of course we had anthem
04:05
now it is a complete deficits bar but no
04:08
micro trends that look next to no no it
04:10
is exactly right right there's a few
04:11
skins in there but all and all it was a
04:13
very micro transaction light game and
04:15
then we're trying to push out a live
04:17
servers that was about the the game and
04:20
yeah and also say EA was quite a
04:23
vindicated in this because everyone's a
04:24
EA ruins and some it circle actually EA
04:27
gave Bioware more than enough rogue gang
04:30
itself money was absolutely on Bioware
04:32
they gave the many years many extensions
04:34
no editorial oversight nothing
04:37
so everything that went wrong with
04:38
anthem was not EA's fault and I think
04:41
everyone in Bioware says that and that
04:43
came through very clearly in the post
04:44
reporting that was provided by Jason's
04:46
Rio trial a small release last year as
04:48
well that was quite well received was
04:49
Need for Speed Heat
04:51
a lot of people liked it and it had no
04:52
microtransactions by the way that's
04:54
surprising yeah but the biggest news
04:55
story was of course Jedi fallen order
04:57
which was the Star Wars respawn game
05:00
very sort of like Uncharted meets Star
05:02
Wars meets secure oh somehow not like
05:05
the perfect game but fantastic Star Wars
05:08
in the collaboration yeah definitely
05:09
know right direction I felt like that
05:10
was the first moment in the last three
05:12
years of this channel where I was like
05:14
okay
05:14
EA good for a moment EA he's done
05:17
something good now I know we really
05:18
shouldn't give them all the props
05:20
because they were really just publishing
05:21
it at the same time they greenlit it
05:23
give them full prize right back in the
05:26
product I agree with that I think they
05:28
they deserve some but really you know
05:29
that was a combination of a lot of great
05:31
people within respawn that made that
05:32
happen and I'm glad that is part of EA
05:34
because it makes EA look a bit better
05:36
and if they've got a pat on the back and
05:38
back for this maybe they'll do more of
05:40
this in the few executives that this
05:42
game was actually salt according to EAS
05:44
earning cause well above expectations
05:46
they expect 8 million units and they're
05:48
expecting it to shoot 10 to 12 million
05:50
units over its lifecycle which is a huge
05:53
success for a game like this so they
05:54
said it was obviously encouraged by the
05:56
fact that you know like it's Star Wars
05:58
and we had Raisa Skywalker coming out
06:00
whatever else great movie by the way
06:02
guys definitely see everyone like think
06:03
it's better than the last Jedi oh man
06:05
how could you top the magnificence for a
06:07
fiction of the last Jedi that is that's
06:09
an unfair call Sam
06:10
so look can I just say on the core
06:13
gaming side I think EA is a much
06:16
improved company than the past like I I
06:17
will happily say that somewhere it's
06:19
very hostile to EAS overall business
06:20
model they delivered Apex Ledger's which
06:23
is a fantastic game the iron crown event
06:25
they had was bullshit nerves look that
06:27
aside that was a block great game need
06:28
for speed he didn't play it but
06:30
well-received no micro transactions they
06:32
didn't like ruin anthem that was
06:34
Bioware's own fault and Jedi fallen
06:36
order was a game they greenlit with no
06:38
micro transactions behind it at all and
06:40
it did well so you know props to EA on
06:43
the core gaming side of their business
06:44
they have made big strides I think and
06:46
that's a good thing and I think we have
06:48
to give the props I agree with that and
06:49
I think also on a sporting side I think
06:52
EA is also doing fantastic work
06:54
I really do make a great sports games
06:57
very load on the micro transfer line to
07:01
sprinkle it on and they're not making a
07:03
little money office right now right the
07:04
medical x cos I think for their most
07:05
recent releases really prove it's just a
07:07
testament to how how good their sports
07:09
games are this you I mean if we look at
07:11
NHL 2020 I mean we've got a four user
07:13
score zero point five that's right and
07:16
all mad and we've got a 1.6 that's
07:18
that's a great score one with six and oh
07:21
look FIFA 21 points so I mean they are
07:24
really now leader on this board side
07:25
consistent quality in their products no
07:28
but look all jokes aside EA Sports
07:30
business continues to be an absolute
07:31
catastrophe they don't care about
07:33
quality and microtransactions aren't
07:35
completely insane and this is coming to
07:37
the head line of story where it's like
07:38
they made a billion dollars this graph
07:40
here actually shows how much money EA
07:42
has made from Live services digital
07:44
networking's
07:45
in the last year that that third column
07:47
across is quarter three FY 24 just for
07:50
the last quarter alone that little green
07:52
section there nine hundred ninety three
07:54
million dollars is what they made from
07:56
live services and that does include like
07:59
that does include you know DLC purchases
08:01
or whatever from let you know whatever
08:03
games but it's the bulk of this is
08:05
actually Ultimate Team for their sports
08:07
products that's where they're making
08:08
this money it's nearly a billion dollars
08:11
then you've got your mobile stuff
08:12
underneath one hundred and thirty four
08:13
million but which games grow full game
08:16
downloads is only sixty percent of their
08:18
revenue in that last corner it just
08:19
shows you how important
08:21
ultimate in businesses look here's a
08:24
deal right that's a ridiculous sum of
08:26
money it's all microtransactions and
08:28
it's never gonna change because sports
08:30
fans don't really care about quality
08:32
yeah we see the the Metacritic score and
08:34
you know it's like yeah cool they
08:36
they're people are outraged whatever
08:37
else but if you look at the sales for
08:40
FIFA and mad and fee for a particular
08:41
FIFA is every single month the
08:43
top-selling game in Europe every month
08:45
like go and look at the UK sales charts
08:47
like five months running its FIFA across
08:49
small platforms it doesn't matter how
08:51
much garbage eh putting out in the
08:53
market in terms of sports products or
08:54
how much they monetize it casual gamers
08:56
will still lap it up and EA knows that
08:59
now as I give I mean I think they've
09:00
known that since the dawn of time what
09:01
you don't mean like I feel like that's
09:04
why we don't really even cover the whole
09:06
what I never got over there are moments
09:07
we've covered FIFA stuff when it's
09:09
particularly egregious but really we're
09:11
like what's the point
09:12
it's a duty to market that doesn't
09:14
really listen you know and I know that
09:15
you know some people it's stereotyping
09:18
that you know you play Cod in FIFA but
09:20
there is a market out there so true that
09:22
that's the reality of some people they
09:24
don't really care about the ins and outs
09:26
of what's going on in the gaming
09:27
industry they just want to buy the
09:28
latest one it has you know twenty twenty
09:31
on it they just want to play with em
09:32
mate right that's all well and good but
09:34
it has consequences of course for the
09:36
gaming industry in general because these
09:38
companies make so much money and then
09:40
they try and leak it into hardcore games
09:42
which EA has done and they failed doing
09:44
yeah so look I think you can kind of
09:46
summarize this is saying on the core
09:47
gaming side of EA's business they've
09:49
made strides and they've made
09:50
improvements and they're putting out
09:51
better quality product because they know
09:53
qual gamers will like make a lot of
09:55
noise you upgrade a lot of problems if
09:57
you don't right but casual gamers don't
09:59
know any better
10:00
and EA have no interest in improving
10:01
quality or improving monetization and so
10:03
EA seems like kind of a split business
10:05
now before they had the objective of
10:07
taking the Ultimate Team product and
10:09
shoving it into their core goals like
10:11
Star Wars like they want to do it with
10:13
battlefield they want to do it all sorts
10:14
of things even Need for Speed when they
10:16
did that they did that levy speed as
10:17
well
10:18
Mass Effect lots of games right but
10:20
they've given up on that now they know
10:21
that gamers will push back on that too
10:22
hard and so they're just focusing on
10:24
their sports products for their bullshit
10:25
and the core gaming side they're like
10:27
let's actually make good game yeah I
10:28
think that's sad for sports fans
10:31
it's never going to change though man I
10:32
mean it looks like I think it is a bit I
10:34
mean it's an elliot a result okay it is
10:37
a for now if that is where we're at I'm
10:40
much happier with the idea of we've
10:42
pushed back as a Kim I'm so proud of the
10:44
community in the last three or four
10:46
years we've got to this stage be great
10:48
if we can continue moving but it's also
10:50
kind of good to know that you know in
10:51
the future people can be a bit more
10:53
excited and it's still a about some of
10:56
the games that are going to be coming
10:58
out in EA that's true you know I mean I
11:00
do agree that in fact that's a good
11:01
segue into the switch section said hey
11:04
we all have aspirations so here's the
11:06
deal with the switch EA has not liked
11:08
the switch up to this point they've only
11:09
released three games on there they've
11:11
got a version of FIFA they've got
11:12
unravel and be like they're two little
11:15
indie games they published they don't
11:17
give a shit about switch up to this
11:18
point they've been waiting to see how it
11:19
goes switch has now sold fifty-two
11:21
million units it's a very assemblage it
11:23
was only 30 million like a few months
11:25
ago horrendous crazy it's great that EA
11:28
now paying attention here's what they
11:29
had to say about switch and whether or
11:31
not EA games are coming to it we're very
11:33
pleased with how well Nintendo has done
11:34
with switch I mean people love the
11:36
platform they enjoy it it's great eh
11:38
chief operating officer and chief
11:40
financial officer Blake Jorgensen
11:42
explained on the company's q3 2013
11:44
earnings call and remember there are a
11:45
lot of people that have both the Xbox
11:47
one and a switch or a PlayStation 4 and
11:49
a switch because it in many ways
11:51
provides a different experience
11:52
particularly a way to access great
11:54
Nintendo software we are always looking
11:56
and discussing with Nintendo what else
11:58
we can put on the platform and as you
12:00
can imagine as the platform grows our
12:01
interest in adding content grows for
12:04
that platform but we're also conscious
12:06
to the fact that top-selling titles by a
12:08
longshot
12:09
are all a Nintendo software which is
12:11
fabulous software but it helps us
12:13
balance sort of the realities of how big
12:16
our markets can be there but trust that
12:18
we're looking into it so what is
12:19
essentially saying here is that like yes
12:21
the switch sells a lot of stuff but the
12:23
reality is people buy the switch to plan
12:24
in Tendo games not to play other games
12:28
there is a huge aspect of on buying a
12:31
switch to step into the Nintendo Marva
12:33
shelf but more and more there is a you
12:35
know the the mood is changing that you
12:37
buy a switch for other games
12:38
yeah totally so don't quite agree with
12:40
that but look you know ei they have
12:42
their own numbers whatever look should
12:44
we get jealous more than order on the
12:45
switch yeah I would love to do that I
12:47
think the real question becomes the
12:48
future titles and this is what we can
12:50
start talking about what they said about
12:51
their future releases so e 8 launched
12:54
seven titles in 2019 now the next
12:56
financial year they actually plan to
12:59
launch a total of 14 games it's a lot
13:01
they're gonna have four sports games
13:03
FIFA Madden NFL and either UFC or NBA
13:07
Live four of the games are from their
13:09
existing IP so we're gonna have Cabana
13:11
Coco remaster which we've already heard
13:12
about we're gonna have middle of one of
13:14
VR game which you've already heard about
13:15
and then there's gonna be at least two
13:17
more games developed by either motive by
13:20
dice Bioware or criterion I think we can
13:22
count by aware out of that list because
13:24
you know we know their games are quite
13:26
far off and you masturbate in your
13:27
dragon age that's not going to be the
13:29
next 12 months we know that there are
13:30
two mobile titles coming as well and the
13:32
remaining four games will be from
13:34
smaller external devs so maybe like
13:36
their EA indie program that they have
13:38
okay so all of this is what yoga soon
13:40
described on the call as a broad-based
13:43
model intended to keep the publisher
13:44
from relying on any one title decreasing
13:47
the risk if one of the game's sells
13:49
below expectations or if say your
13:51
company goes through some massive drama
13:53
and explodes again like it was
13:54
Battlefront 2 so you're not over blames
13:56
go out they have other games I mean this
13:58
is the prom with Activision like they
13:59
really don't have more than likely don't
14:01
call the Judi yeah you know well I've
14:03
said this before they've also got Guitar
14:05
Hero okay it's coming back I promise
14:07
they should bring it back but anyway he
14:08
also had some comments about next-gen es
14:11
CFO Blake Jorgensen was quite vocal
14:13
about the possibilities that could open
14:15
up once next-gen consoles finally make
14:17
their way into the world saying the
14:19
power of the new consoles is going to be
14:21
substantially greater than the existing
14:23
consoles not only that but yo Genson
14:25
thinks that the things both next-gen
14:27
consoles can do will generally surprise
14:29
gamers we can do a lot more with PS 5
14:31
and Xbox Series X he added things we're
14:34
doing will blow people's minds so
14:36
clearly the Xbox Series X and PS 5 are
14:38
going to be stronger than their
14:39
predecessors but that already seems like
14:42
a given and the significance of yogurts
14:44
and statement comes from the implication
14:45
that the technology leap between current
14:47
and next gen consoles is going to be
14:49
bigger than X
14:50
which we kind of know already because
14:51
you know let the whole cpu thing hold
14:54
it's a state thing like I'm sure there's
14:55
some other things they don't even know
14:56
about yet so that's great news
14:58
the only thing we know is confirmed for
14:59
next-gen consoles for EA is the next
15:02
battlefield game battlefield 6 is
15:04
definitely gonna be launching there'll
15:06
be some good means in that surely oh
15:07
yeah every other battlefield launch is
15:09
anything to go by I think overall I
15:11
think EA is a very interesting company
15:12
at this point right because they really
15:14
have two business models operating
15:17
simultaneously side by side that are
15:19
very different we have a core gaming
15:20
business that's actually putting out
15:22
pretty decent games and then you have a
15:24
sports business which is a complete
15:26
ripoff putting out garbage and just
15:28
basically like just just just scamming
15:31
people and built on loot boxes endlessly
15:33
with no signs of change and that is
15:35
actually where the majority of EA's
15:37
money is coming from like that's that's
15:39
the reality palace yet what yeah
15:40
so look I again I like the fact that
15:43
they haven't they've cleaned up the core
15:45
gaming side of their business I wish
15:46
they would do the same thing to sports
15:47
kids I remember when I used to play
15:49
sports games right now we used to play
15:50
them one weekend are we used to play we
15:52
split matter yes and now there's no
15:54
where's games whatever pole no way oh I
15:57
remember NFL Blitz 2000 or whatever it's
15:59
called the one on Dreamcast anyway yeah
16:01
though there were sports cancer we did
16:02
love and the brother rugby mm great game
16:05
that was actually a great guy but look
16:07
it is good to see that they're doing
16:09
some some you know good stuff in the
16:10
single-player front and a hardcore game
16:12
front but look they're still very in my
16:15
opinion at risk all it takes is you know
16:17
some sort of domino effect with with
16:20
governments just start banning this shit
16:22
and they've lost what 90% of their
16:24
revenue yeah absolutely round as a
16:26
company they would immediately topple if
16:27
loot boxes were banned
16:29
I can't who knows what they would do I
16:31
can't think of a more risky company
16:32
apart from like I even Activision sure
16:35
that bit load on the IPE but they got
16:37
Blizzard like you know they're kind of
16:38
gonna be okay but he a it's all reliant
16:41
on the government's playing ball with
16:42
them which is a pretty risky thing but
16:44
anyway with Sam's comment about blizzard
16:46
let's end the episode love you blizzard
16:48
love you guys thank me new Blizzard
16:49
episodes me

# Stadia vs GeForce Now

when we say that guys stadia obviously
01:39
we've spoken about quite a while it's a
01:41
streaming service that you should not
01:42
purchase because it will not exist in
01:44
two years and all of your money but even
01:45
we asked what it has done though is set
01:48
off the sort of cloud streaming wars of
01:50
this generation the idea that you'd
01:53
actually have to buy hardware to play
01:54
games you can kind of just stream it in
01:56
the cloud not a new idea it's actually
01:58
been around for a very long time it's
02:00
just taken a long time to get the
02:01
technology really where it's scalable
02:03
and also it's taken time for people's
02:04
internet to catch up and be ready to go
02:06
we've spoken a lot about how stadia is
02:09
terrible and etc etc I'm not gonna talk
02:11
about it again but what's clear though
02:13
is that lots of competitors are popping
02:14
up yeah just as like nip at their heels
02:16
most recently project X cloud has really
02:18
been getting a lot of momentum offering
02:20
what is a fantastic service without the
02:22
need to spend extra money or buy extra
02:24
game yeah that's already a massive win
02:26
and we've played it it felt fantastic in
02:28
terms of where it's at I know there's
02:30
probably a lot more to go in terms of
02:31
what they want to do but where it's at
02:32
now it feels great and everyone that's
02:35
played stadia has said it was absolutely
02:37
horrendous well ok let's just be clear
02:38
about that lots of people have said it's
02:40
horrendous
02:40
lots of people have had or some people
02:42
have had a good experience with it as
02:44
well so we don't want to we don't want
02:45
to mischaracterize that some people are
02:47
enjoying their time we stadium I think
02:48
Aero shoe has only ever been about well
02:50
there's two things one stadia is a paid
02:52
beta right now okay and it should not be
02:54
charging people for access to what is
02:56
any complete product and to the business
02:58
model behind it yeah the technology will
03:00
get better it's the business model that
03:02
makes it so bad where you need to pay
03:04
for access
03:04
pay for hardware and pay for games thank
03:06
you complete madness and all those games
03:08
by the way are separate from your
03:09
existing library of games you need to
03:11
buy them again and they don't have any
03:12
kind of cross save capability so that's
03:14
mad
03:15
Autobots and now a new challenger has
03:23
emerged okay now it's called g-force now
03:26
it is from Nvidia Nvidia something like
03:28
that nice and they now want to get into
03:30
the streaming the streaming wars okay
03:32
and I think no but what a better time to
03:34
do it well it actually is a good time to
03:36
do it it is actually you can get in
03:38
before X cloud and Pierce now and EA's
03:40
streaming which they also want to do get
03:43
in before you might have a good shot of
03:44
creating a market feels yeah when you
03:46
say get into it I mean it's true in the
03:49
sense that it's launching right now in
03:51
North America in Europe and in Japan and
03:55
in Korea okay which career north or
03:57
south everybody's mo and oh they're not
03:59
Australia of course surprisingly left
04:01
out of some cloud streaming a lot of
04:02
thought they're not like it's not new by
04:06
the way this has actually been around
04:07
for many years they have been beat a
04:09
testing this product for at least two
04:11
years now I think maybe even three years
04:13
that they've had this beta test running
04:14
yeah so this isn't like hey we've got
04:16
this new bullshit thing that we've never
04:18
tested before pay us some money for it
04:21
[Music]
04:24
they put a lot of groundwork into this
04:26
already and the results are pretty
04:28
positive yeah this is the thing I mean
04:30
it's good to see that they have been I
04:31
didn't even know they were doing it
04:33
better for this but it is good to know
04:34
they've been doing a two solid two or
04:36
three years of doing this to a point
04:38
where they want to show the market and
04:39
you know the actual pricing is a very
04:41
very compelling okay it's five dollars a
04:44
month okay if you want to pay for it if
04:46
you do not want to pay for it you get an
04:48
hour a day or an hour in a certain
04:51
timeframe than you have to wait in a
04:52
queue again and if you want to pay the
04:54
five dollars a month to get priority
04:56
queuing and you get six hours that you
04:58
can play this thing non-stop yeah and
05:00
that's a lot I mean it is it's not
05:01
enough from I says some people don't
05:03
want to sit there on a Sunday and play
05:05
like eight hours of games but I mean six
05:07
hours of streaming you're probably not
05:09
going to do that if you're sitting there
05:10
for six or ten hours playing you're
05:12
probably doing it on your TV or your PC
05:14
everybody yeah I feel like six hours is
05:16
obviously like it's a limit and I'm sure
05:18
some people it that's unacceptable but
05:20
it's like look man if you're gonna play
05:21
10 hours of games you've probably got
05:22
yourself some local hardware you're
05:24
playing on the air
05:25
probably not for you don't I mean but
05:26
look the thing about this is it's a try
05:28
before you buy skin which is another
05:29
thing that stadia does not offer right
05:31
now we study if you want to try it you
05:33
have to pay money from you have to buy
05:35
the hardware you have to buy access to
05:36
the system at this point it'll be free
05:38
later on but like you have to pay money
05:40
you can't there's no try before you buy
05:42
with stadia you have to spend at least
05:43
130 bucks to get it going right but this
05:45
it's like well try it for an hour if it
05:47
works and you're enjoying yourself cool
05:49
pay five dollars a month and now you
05:51
have access to your existing library
05:54
games and this is another point the way
05:56
this works with GeForce now is that it's
05:58
essentially like a computer in the cloud
06:01
now if you imagine stadia is like an
06:03
interface in the cloud that allows you
06:05
to boot up a single game from the stadia
06:07
sort of archives and you can play it I'm
06:09
one marketplace correct not like that
06:11
with GeForce now GeForce now sort of
06:13
provisions you a computer in the cloud
06:15
that can run steam it can run battlenet
06:18
it can run epic games bad and it can run
06:21
you play okay so you basically log into
06:25
your accounts on the cloud for those
06:27
launches and then the games on those
06:30
launches are cached in the cloud which
06:33
means that you don't really need you
06:34
don't need to download the games onto
06:35
that sort of like cloud computer you can
06:37
just start playing them immediately your
06:39
own account with your own progress you
06:41
know with your own games with your own
06:43
sort of like skins that you've purchased
06:45
it's all automatically there you don't
06:47
need to buy any additional games with
06:49
this service unlike with stadia I'm just
06:51
gonna keep comparing this thing to
06:53
Stadium as I just never get tired I mean
06:55
III see why there because stadia was
06:57
like the first coming-out party of
06:59
streaming it was the biggest
07:01
announcement and biggest drop of
07:03
streaming that we've seen so a lot of
07:04
people started their conversation off
07:06
the back of stage yeah even though they
07:08
were actually things before that like
07:10
there was this thing called shadow by
07:11
the way which is very similar to GeForce
07:13
now which is like a computer in the
07:14
cloud and then of course there's you
07:16
know project desk layer which we've
07:17
spoken about a lot there's also going to
07:19
be well PS now is already live but they
07:21
haven't really sort of promoted that
07:23
much and in the future amazon have
07:25
hinted that they are working on a
07:26
streaming platform as well so this is a
07:27
very crowded space if you're interested
07:29
in some of the details around what you
07:31
need to get this going as I said you
07:33
need to be in North America in Europe in
07:35
Japan or in Korea you
07:37
a minimum of 15 megabytes down to get
07:40
things going pretty achiever believable
07:42
you need a recommended 34 if you want to
07:44
do 1080p 60 streaming and you
07:46
recommended 50 if you want to have like
07:48
a flawless uninterrupted kind of session
07:50
with you know buffering or whatever else
07:52
so I think look that's obviously a lot
07:54
but a lot of people have that these days
07:55
not in Australia but anyway we'll come
07:57
back to that yeah we're also expecting
07:58
20 milliseconds when you are playing
08:00
that has been promised to 80% of the
08:03
homes within North America and Europe
08:05
and in Korea and Japan you can expect 10
08:07
milliseconds latency which is very good
08:09
at everybody imagine living in a country
08:11
with some good internet one of the other
08:16
things as well as that they're currently
08:18
upgrading their hardware so that your
08:20
games on GeForce now when you stream
08:21
them will be ray tracing enabled like
08:23
nicest thing we're doing that's pretty
08:25
impressive man like yeah I think there's
08:27
a huge I'd buy that for a dollar and
08:29
that for five bucks a month the thing is
08:30
it actually is a huge drop curve because
08:32
a lot of people don't have the money yet
08:33
to jump on and buy the GTX 1060 or ten
08:35
twenty sixty to eighty I should say but
08:38
they want to try and experience ray
08:40
tracing you know well worth the five
08:41
bucks a month for sure and look it's
08:43
apparently gonna be at the moment
08:44
holding up to six hundred thousand
08:46
players at any given moment that are
08:48
playing and that probably will increase
08:50
your little increase in time I mean if
08:53
it's a free service you can play an hour
08:55
a day I reckon that'll be full pretty
08:57
quick actually yeah hopefully that does
08:59
increase but they don't need to increase
09:01
it for Australians because we're not
09:02
paying in this Friday interesting also
09:04
no iPhone Apple support at this moment
09:07
it is on android everybody correct first
09:09
time ever I think they brought something
09:11
to Android first and not because they
09:13
know PC people use Android yeah and they
09:16
knew like Instagram models you know in
09:20
terms of how the service before business
09:22
journalists from the verge here says
09:23
that he was able to begin Ichiro
09:25
insecure Oh on the service that's pretty
09:27
cool I mean I didn't have a beta so
09:29
literally oh yeah it was it was not it's
09:31
obviously good enough to be able to do
09:33
that
09:33
look just to summarize what they see
09:34
it's okay you pay five dollars a month
09:36
and you can play it wherever you like on
09:38
any device that's an Android device you
09:41
just need like 30 megabytes down and you
09:45
can get 1080p streaming you don't
09:47
need to buy any additional games you are
09:50
logging into your existing game accounts
09:53
with all your existing progress and
09:54
whatever else 20 millisecond response
09:57
time in most countries 10 milliseconds
09:59
in Japan and Korea it's been beta tested
10:02
for years so it actually has a good sort
10:05
of solid track record we know it works
10:06
this is how you launch product like this
10:08
man and it's like it's just further
10:10
evidence to me the stadia is doomed
10:14
there's no way stadia survives between
10:16
Pierce now between project s cloud
10:18
between Amazon's future service and
10:20
between this there is no way that
10:22
business model survived I think I'm I
10:23
think I think the killer here for stadia
10:25
is you know you're already able to
10:27
access your current games where stadia
10:29
is expecting you to build another like
10:31
can't believe that and that is where
10:32
that's the killer you know if they
10:34
wanted you to jump on and you pay for
10:36
the service but you have access to your
10:37
games different story correct I think
10:39
they've liked what GeForce now is doing
10:41
is exactly what they need to do it
10:42
actually best of luck to them because
10:44
that's awesome to see we have another
10:45
competitor on PC that's gonna give
10:47
stadia a run for its money
10:49
which is not hard cuz steady is not
10:51
doing well anyway but anyway that is it
10:53
pretty much today Steve yeah Bailey
10:59
[Music]
11:00
[Applause]
11:04
[Music]
11:08
[Applause]
11:11
stadia the look you want in performance
11:14
basketball running and court shoes at
11:16
Kinney the great American shoe store


# Solo il 10% degli sviluppatori sta lavorando alla next gen

it's console yeah yeah cos øz really low
00:28
comes rain every six years ESO news some
00:30
other we love spending $1200 on new
00:32
hardware new controllers new probably
00:36
TVs yeah it's an excuse Kay and shit
00:40
yeah new weird gimmicks that we think we
00:43
want but we really don't like what the
00:45
hell is this it's actually an electronic
00:48
device that senses and reacts to your
00:50
movements it'll turn physical force and
00:52
a powerful it the next gen consoles
00:55
promise sixteen times the detail but
00:58
they're not engendering 16 times the
01:00
enthusiasm from developing on there elf
01:02
engender engender yes it's a word let's
01:07
keep moving guys there was a survey done
01:09
by GDC the Game Developers Conference
01:11
they do it every single year it's called
01:13
state of the game and it talked about
01:14
the current state of mind of most
01:16
developers and what they're working on
01:17
it showed that there's not a lot of
01:19
people making games for next gen and
01:21
next gen is really close that's a bit
01:24
concerning should we drop as raw
01:29
[Music]
01:32
so in terms of next consoles everybody
01:35
there's apparently a big announcement
01:37
next month PS 5 we're hearing all the
01:39
bans a month oh wait we in February no
01:40
no yet apparently got a war 2 and we're
01:43
excited if it is I don't think that's
01:44
true neither confirm nor deny oK we've
01:47
already heard about that Xbox series X
01:49
that is coming at the end of the year
01:51
this is definitely all coming I reckon
01:53
at December 2020 got ten months yeah
01:56
well this whole die now look
01:57
realistically no babe
02:02
Evan Anderson Harlan now now word fib
02:05
now or two seconds ago we wearing fit
02:06
one day away from family but the point
02:09
is yes consoles are coming this year
02:10
it's very exciting we do look forward to
02:12
it you know it's a chance for the
02:13
industry to rejuvenate or take a bit of
02:15
a step up however it seems like the step
02:17
up won't be as immediate as we might
02:19
have liked now the survey we're getting
02:21
our information here from is GDC state
02:24
of the game server now GDC is the game
02:26
develops conference happens every year
02:28
in March
02:28
yep and it's like you know just
02:30
basically dudes get together and hang
02:32
out and talk about stuff and it's
02:34
actually quite a fascinating event I've
02:35
never been but I definitely watched it
02:36
will she go do we should go I'm sure
02:38
developers would love to see us hey can
02:40
you sponsor us will join for bring us
02:45
there and then it would be great
02:47
now this survey basically asked them you
02:49
know what's up what are you working on
02:51
what are you thinking about there was a
02:52
specific section of the survey that
02:53
talked about the hardware and next-gen
02:56
and I think it had some really
02:57
interesting insights that I personally
02:58
wasn't expecting given that we are only
03:00
a few months away from the launch of
03:02
next-gen hardware in particular number
03:04
one headline tomorrow PC master-race
03:07
the PC is still the dominant platform
03:10
and will continue to be the donor
03:11
platform respondents 50% of devs said
03:15
that their last game came to PC so the
03:17
game they just made the current game
03:20
that they are working on is going to be
03:21
released on PC and the games they will
03:23
make after that will also be released on
03:26
PC 50% of developers said that making it
03:28
the dominant platform
03:29
see we love you salutes god bless you PC
03:32
master-race these ones that Australian I
03:35
don't even know yeah that's right you're
03:36
right like this I do care once PC is the
03:39
universal platform everybody okay that's
03:41
where all the devs you know are gonna
03:43
make their money regardless of what
03:44
console is out or not really everyone
03:46
has a piece and even I even like you
03:48
know stuff that's coming to Xbox
03:49
exclusively is also coded PC so PC
03:52
master-race
03:52
mm-hm anyway let's move on to the actual
03:55
real headline which is about next-gen
03:57
Hardware okay this is a very interesting
03:59
figure and they asked developers are you
04:02
making games for next-gen only 10% of
04:06
developers are currently making games
04:09
for next-gen 11 percent of developers
04:12
are making games for the PS 5 do right
04:14
now and nine percent are making games
04:16
for xbox series X right now so there's
04:19
only a 2% difference between those I
04:21
don't really think that's material
04:22
that's I don't know there's anything to
04:23
worry about but firmly is it just shows
04:25
the PlayStation 5 is of course
04:27
dominating the market yeah and a snowman
04:29
out yet no but like I hear you like 10%
04:32
of Deb's making next-gen is small I
04:34
wonder what the figures were like for
04:36
360 for you know PlayStation 2 do you
04:38
know I mean like I feel like I would
04:40
expect that majority of Deb's need to
04:43
make sure that they're taken care of of
04:44
their own profits and all the market at
04:48
the moment is still of course
04:49
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one that's where
04:52
they're gonna make their money you
04:53
remember two things that know number one
04:54
they're already doing this whole like
04:56
you can play your Wix box1 games on the
04:57
one Xbox one X series so there's gonna
04:59
be a cross thing anyway so a lot of
05:01
those games that do come out you can
05:02
play them on there anyway right and
05:04
number two when a new console comes out
05:06
I remember them only having like yes
05:08
five or six major time like one may you
05:11
know what I'm saying there right but you
05:13
would hope that would be different
05:14
though like you would hope that this
05:15
generation might change and they jump on
05:17
Nixon Hardware faster seems like that's
05:19
not the case but look if you're still
05:20
skeptical about those numbers they also
05:22
asked your next game that you will make
05:24
right so these developers are working on
05:26
a game right now but the one they plan
05:28
to make after that will that game come
05:30
to next-gen
05:32
23% of those developers said that their
05:34
next game will come to PS 5 17% of those
05:38
developers said it will come to project
05:39
Scarlett or you know
05:41
it's a long name again not a lot not
05:45
like that because that's your next game
05:47
there is a point here around what
05:49
platforms developers are interested in
05:51
developing for okay and 38% of
05:55
developers say they would like to
05:56
develop for ps5 and that's not saying
05:58
that they will awarenesses that their
06:00
personal interest in the game 25 percent
06:03
have said Xbox Series X 37% say Nintendo
06:07
switch there is already a noticeable gap
06:09
there in terms of games being made for
06:11
next gen consoles between playstation 5
06:13
and series x and also the interest of
06:15
the developers that is a noticeable
06:17
thing I think that's actually probably
06:19
just a lagging but you know of the
06:21
effects of the current gen shop battle
06:24
you know let's face it did Xbox one did
06:27
lose this console generation if I'm a
06:30
developer I know that there's probably
06:31
less money on there for me so it's
06:34
probably bit of an aftertaste about that
06:35
whole you know last gen didn't do too
06:38
well for Xbox I'm sure that's probably
06:39
what those speakers are coming I agree
06:40
look I think this makes a lot more sense
06:42
when we start talking about last or the
06:45
current gen console and how developers
06:47
are planning to approach that so when
06:49
asked are you making games for the
06:52
current gen so ps4 and Xbox one 25
06:54
percent of developers are working on ps4
06:56
games 23 percent are working on games
06:59
which is a lot closer actually they ask
07:01
your next game that you make after this
07:03
one okay will that come out on ps4 and
07:05
Xbox 20% of respondents say their next
07:08
game will come out on ps4 20 percent say
07:11
their next game will come out on Xbox so
07:12
again that's not the one that they are
07:14
working on right now that's the one they
07:16
plan to start making and ship after that
07:18
20 percent of developers are still
07:20
planning cross-generational at least we
07:23
get this number five percent of
07:24
developers say they are targeting
07:26
next-gen exclusives for their next game
07:28
so only 5% of developers are working on
07:31
next-gen consoles exclusively that's
07:33
really low man I mean what we said
07:35
earlier that 10% of developers are
07:37
making games for next-gen that's fine
07:39
but they're also making games for last
07:42
gen as well another really interesting
07:43
tidbit was that 34% of developers
07:45
confirmed that their current project the
07:48
game they are currently working on will
07:49
be
07:50
on both generations mom hardware which
07:52
means that we are going to see a hell of
07:54
a lot of game release on ps4 remaster
07:57
released on PS 5 etc like the optional
08:00
version ok we saw a lot of last gen it's
08:02
gonna be even more this time it seemed
08:04
so I think what we can summarize from
08:05
all of this is that there's no way like
08:07
developers are moving on from current
08:09
gen hardware anytime soon ok they still
08:12
have an interest in making games for
08:14
both generations of hardware even though
08:17
the new hardware is arriving and they're
08:18
going to take their sweet-ass time in
08:20
making next gen exclusives that not
08:22
happening each time so yeah and it kind
08:23
of good to have you know a situation if
08:26
I was to go out and buy a console it's
08:28
gonna cost me 600 bucks that I feel like
08:30
there is going to be a bit of a library
08:31
there that's gonna be on both consoles
08:33
like I like that but from what we've
08:35
seen before and the worry in the
08:37
community now is like is this a decision
08:39
with developers kind of doing it on both
08:42
consoles it's just gonna hold back the
08:44
next gen and the games really look like
08:46
and creative ideas yeah on those game
08:48
and this was the bigger issue with
08:49
Microsoft recently announcing that all
08:51
of their games on Microsoft all their
08:53
first plate exclusives will be cross-gen
08:55
for at least the first one to two years
08:57
people really upset about that because
08:58
they're like no I don't want you to do
09:00
that I want you to make games
09:01
exclusively for next gen hardware with
09:03
faster CPU with faster SSD etc I want
09:06
you to shoot for the moon right and I
09:08
get that I get that as well again the
09:10
reality is Microsoft were not holding
09:12
anyone back the developers hold
09:14
themselves back like this survey itself
09:16
proves that it's not about like they see
09:19
the commercial imperative of releasing
09:21
their games on massive install bases of
09:23
hardware you've got a hundred million
09:25
110 million ps4 is in circulation you're
09:28
crazy if you don't release your games on
09:29
that so they are naturally going to hold
09:31
back their games to ensure that they can
09:33
also run on a ps4 that's just life over
09:36
time that changes of course certainly at
09:38
the beginning during the transition
09:39
first one to two year of hardware that's
09:41
gonna be the case even yeah I mean I
09:42
just think you'd be crazy
09:44
given the figures of the ps4 over a
09:46
hundred million console install base or
09:48
something yeah it's just gigantic I mean
09:50
as a developer I need to make sure that
09:52
I'm making money and I'm
09:53
opening those doors so I get it there's
09:55
some people like I've to spend 600 bucks
09:56
on this man make sure you give me the
09:58
best damn experience you've also gotta
09:59
understand as a developer they need to
10:01
make sure that they got the money to
10:02
continue making games for the next-gen
10:04
and yes interesting enough Nintendo
10:07
seems to be immune from all of this 17%
10:09
of developers are currently developing
10:11
for the switch and 19% said their next
10:14
game will be on switch so that's because
10:16
it's going well they can not get me in
10:18
returns on the pre-orders we'll put it
10:21
on there okay pre-order that shit we get
10:23
money and we know we're keeping it there
10:25
was also some stuff there was also some
10:27
stuff about VR and AR augmented reality
10:29
50% of developers are currently working
10:31
on VR titles 7% are working on AR titles
10:36
27% of developers are interested in
10:39
working on VR 16% are interested in
10:42
augmented reality there's a speaker here
10:45
that says only 10% of developers are
10:47
working on PS VR games that's compared
10:49
to 25% for the oculus rift s and 24% for
10:53
the quest that's a disappointing number
10:55
for Sony given the fact that they have
10:56
made a very big push into VR they've
10:59
said it's a real flagship offering to
11:01
see only 10% of developers are currently
11:02
working on games for it I'm sure kind of
11:04
hurts not to mention we've seen that we
11:05
they might have plans for like psvr to
11:08
know they are doubling down on that if
11:10
you're different if they were like going
11:11
well we'll just see how that goes it
11:12
seems like they're putting more into it
11:14
there's also interesting data here about
11:15
streaming platforms turns out 6% of
11:18
developers are currently making games
11:19
with Google stadia 3% of the developers
11:22
are currently making games for xbox
11:24
that's different though because they're
11:26
like we're gonna make this for Xbox
11:28
anyone know this is different because
11:30
what they're asking here is are you
11:32
making games specifically leveraging
11:34
that technol with a computer game right
11:36
now the Xbox has specifically said that
11:39
they plan to make games exclusively for
11:41
X cloud but they are not doing that yet
11:44
meirin talks that was actually a
11:46
conversation that I had with the head of
11:48
X cloud myself where they specifically
11:50
said they are in early talks to make
11:52
exclusive X cloud content in the future
11:55
but they're not doing it yet
11:56
but either way look I think that you
11:58
know what this data shows over a lot of
12:00
numbers today a lot of numbers today but
12:02
I think the highest level takeaway is
12:04
the next-gen
12:05
coming but it's gonna take a while okay
12:07
it's not like they flick a light switch
12:08
and everyone's making gains to NexGen
12:10
only ten percent of developers are
12:11
currently working on a next-gen title
12:13
and furthermore all of those developers
12:15
plan on releasing pretty much you know
12:17
the both of their current project and
12:19
their next project on both generations
12:21
of hardware the next-gen the next round
12:23
of games we get the next sort of two to
12:25
three years are still going to be held
12:27
back by last gen hardware that's just a
12:29
fact of life so I think a lot of people
12:30
that want to jump on to the next gen you
12:32
know 60 bucks is a lot of money if they
12:34
can see data or if they can see all the
12:36
games that they want are coming out on
12:39
the current console gen you know maybe
12:41
that'll affect console sales slightly
12:43
knowing that a lot of the games that you
12:45
know and love are also going to be on
12:46
the current gen but maybe not I don't
12:48
think it'll console sales at all I think
12:50
these consoles will unquestionably just
12:52
continue to sell out like you know in
12:54
that first opening window I think
12:55
everyone kind of knows this is the
12:57
rhythm of console releases where there's
12:59
not a lot of stuff at the beginning and
13:00
you do see remaster what have you when
13:02
that changes over time but I think this
13:04
does help sort of set expectations and
13:05
make that clear we've got some data to
13:07
suggest that yes it's not gonna be this
13:09
immediate rush of next gen titles yeah
13:11
leveraging the technology it's gonna
13:13
take time for that to ramp up so I think
13:15
that's what I take from this data either
13:16
way games men games what a game we love
13:19
video games and there's more coming in
13:21
this year with twenty twenty twenty five
13:23
twenty rush get your wallets ready and
13:26
have our vision good because there's
13:29
twenty twenty in there's jokes about AI
13:30
vision
