# EA fa un miliardo di dollari su Fifa!

ladies and gentlemen hello and welcome
00:01
to the annual general meeting for laymen
00:03
gaming we worked very hard here to
00:06
defeat EA and reduce its revenues in
00:10
micro transactions and after two and a
00:12
half years of work I'm sure we've
00:13
achieved great success Sam tell me
00:15
what's what are the numbers like
00:17
certainly have let's have a look at them
00:21
EA made 1 billion of micro transactions
00:25
just the last quarter alone so at least
00:30
it's not a million and one leyland save
00:38
gaming we stopped EA for making a
00:41
billion and $1 that's good so you're
00:43
welcome
00:44
reddit's you're welcome how it feels to
00:47
chew 5 come guys layman we fought the
00:55
good fight against EA we really started
00:59
our channel 2017 actually it was Oliver
01:01
da okay June 2017 after we got back from
01:03
e3 being your cameraman got it sucked
01:07
anyway it was still good followed you I
01:09
you are still my camera oh yeah still
01:10
we're still having fun to this day okay
01:12
we started with EA and now we are back
01:14
talking about here that's right because
01:16
what they've done recently is an
01:17
earnings call where they talk about how
01:18
much money they've made and they made a
01:22
lot of money from micro transactions 1
01:23
billion dollars from micro transactions
01:25
last quarter alone and they also talked
01:27
about the future of EA as a company what
01:30
they're working on next stuff they do
01:32
with Nintendo a Nintendo switch stuff
01:34
for next gen their future of life
01:36
services they're actually quite a bit
01:38
here some of it is kind of good news to
01:40
be honest with you some of it is VA
01:42
gonna be a sabbatical
01:44
[Music]
01:49
so guys again this channel was built on
01:52
the motto EA bad okay quick fatal so
01:55
let's roll some old footage
01:57
hello fam I'm layman and this is gaming
02:00
don't call them fam trauma thing
02:01
cofferdam is so done right now it's so
02:03
finished okay look how much Sam has
02:06
changed /a age in that time this way
02:09
that's what happen to a blink and
02:10
everybody if you look at photos of him
02:12
okay he's for the wedding of the world
02:14
his shoulders say to me but I wasn't
02:16
that the very first I was Belle Epoque
02:17
video we do has the worst life ratio
02:19
because it was before everyone realized
02:21
it was garbage
02:22
so obviously EA has had a very rocky
02:24
past it had Star Wars Battlefront 2
02:25
being one of the biggest launches asses
02:28
in video game history culminating in the
02:30
most downloaded reddit post in history
02:31
that wonderful pride and accomplishment
02:33
war that was better for us to of cuddles
02:35
the does loot yeah stuff with loot boxes
02:37
and actually tribute triggered a global
02:39
sort of like government push back
02:42
against loot boxes which still continues
02:43
to this day by the way you had the
02:45
disastrous battlefield 5 launch both in
02:47
terms of like the tone of the game the
02:49
way they engage their audiences and all
02:50
the bugs in the game that actually
02:52
persists to this day by the way yeah and
02:54
then of course you had stuff like the
02:56
cancellation of project ragtag that star
02:58
would all be with Amy Hennig you had
02:59
closure of studios you had like the
03:01
death of single-player games really how
03:03
EA once declared that the market really
03:05
was is interested in single-player game
03:07
right they were stuck to their guns okay
03:11
they do not come out with another game
03:12
out of the out of the ruins of ragtag so
03:15
so basically
03:16
TLDR EA shit tier company for a long
03:20
last time what's changed though with EA
03:22
because there has actually been some
03:24
changes yes there has
03:25
okay so let's start with Apex legends
03:27
are absolutely no marketing comes out of
03:29
nowhere
03:30
made by respawn jumps on the scene it is
03:33
a battle royale and it's actually really
03:36
bloody good it is a and it actually gets
03:38
a bit of a following pretty quickly and
03:41
it's still pretty you know important to
03:44
this day stars it's a fortnight big but
03:46
it definitely made a dent on the battle
03:47
royale mark that's a launch season for
03:49
as well it's got really momentum in
03:51
season three had more engagement in
03:53
season two according to EA three numbers
03:54
and they're about well the star working
03:56
on a mobile version of the game which
03:58
will surely go Ganga
03:59
and I'm gonna be really good with no
04:00
microtransactions in of course but for
04:02
now look that has been pretty well
04:03
received then we of course we had anthem
04:05
now it is a complete deficits bar but no
04:08
micro trends that look next to no no it
04:10
is exactly right right there's a few
04:11
skins in there but all and all it was a
04:13
very micro transaction light game and
04:15
then we're trying to push out a live
04:17
servers that was about the the game and
04:20
yeah and also say EA was quite a
04:23
vindicated in this because everyone's a
04:24
EA ruins and some it circle actually EA
04:27
gave Bioware more than enough rogue gang
04:30
itself money was absolutely on Bioware
04:32
they gave the many years many extensions
04:34
no editorial oversight nothing
04:37
so everything that went wrong with
04:38
anthem was not EA's fault and I think
04:41
everyone in Bioware says that and that
04:43
came through very clearly in the post
04:44
reporting that was provided by Jason's
04:46
Rio trial a small release last year as
04:48
well that was quite well received was
04:49
Need for Speed Heat
04:51
a lot of people liked it and it had no
04:52
microtransactions by the way that's
04:54
surprising yeah but the biggest news
04:55
story was of course Jedi fallen order
04:57
which was the Star Wars respawn game
05:00
very sort of like Uncharted meets Star
05:02
Wars meets secure oh somehow not like
05:05
the perfect game but fantastic Star Wars
05:08
in the collaboration yeah definitely
05:09
know right direction I felt like that
05:10
was the first moment in the last three
05:12
years of this channel where I was like
05:14
okay
05:14
EA good for a moment EA he's done
05:17
something good now I know we really
05:18
shouldn't give them all the props
05:20
because they were really just publishing
05:21
it at the same time they greenlit it
05:23
give them full prize right back in the
05:26
product I agree with that I think they
05:28
they deserve some but really you know
05:29
that was a combination of a lot of great
05:31
people within respawn that made that
05:32
happen and I'm glad that is part of EA
05:34
because it makes EA look a bit better
05:36
and if they've got a pat on the back and
05:38
back for this maybe they'll do more of
05:40
this in the few executives that this
05:42
game was actually salt according to EAS
05:44
earning cause well above expectations
05:46
they expect 8 million units and they're
05:48
expecting it to shoot 10 to 12 million
05:50
units over its lifecycle which is a huge
05:53
success for a game like this so they
05:54
said it was obviously encouraged by the
05:56
fact that you know like it's Star Wars
05:58
and we had Raisa Skywalker coming out
06:00
whatever else great movie by the way
06:02
guys definitely see everyone like think
06:03
it's better than the last Jedi oh man
06:05
how could you top the magnificence for a
06:07
fiction of the last Jedi that is that's
06:09
an unfair call Sam
06:10
so look can I just say on the core
06:13
gaming side I think EA is a much
06:16
improved company than the past like I I
06:17
will happily say that somewhere it's
06:19
very hostile to EAS overall business
06:20
model they delivered Apex Ledger's which
06:23
is a fantastic game the iron crown event
06:25
they had was bullshit nerves look that
06:27
aside that was a block great game need
06:28
for speed he didn't play it but
06:30
well-received no micro transactions they
06:32
didn't like ruin anthem that was
06:34
Bioware's own fault and Jedi fallen
06:36
order was a game they greenlit with no
06:38
micro transactions behind it at all and
06:40
it did well so you know props to EA on
06:43
the core gaming side of their business
06:44
they have made big strides I think and
06:46
that's a good thing and I think we have
06:48
to give the props I agree with that and
06:49
I think also on a sporting side I think
06:52
EA is also doing fantastic work
06:54
I really do make a great sports games
06:57
very load on the micro transfer line to
07:01
sprinkle it on and they're not making a
07:03
little money office right now right the
07:04
medical x cos I think for their most
07:05
recent releases really prove it's just a
07:07
testament to how how good their sports
07:09
games are this you I mean if we look at
07:11
NHL 2020 I mean we've got a four user
07:13
score zero point five that's right and
07:16
all mad and we've got a 1.6 that's
07:18
that's a great score one with six and oh
07:21
look FIFA 21 points so I mean they are
07:24
really now leader on this board side
07:25
consistent quality in their products no
07:28
but look all jokes aside EA Sports
07:30
business continues to be an absolute
07:31
catastrophe they don't care about
07:33
quality and microtransactions aren't
07:35
completely insane and this is coming to
07:37
the head line of story where it's like
07:38
they made a billion dollars this graph
07:40
here actually shows how much money EA
07:42
has made from Live services digital
07:44
networking's
07:45
in the last year that that third column
07:47
across is quarter three FY 24 just for
07:50
the last quarter alone that little green
07:52
section there nine hundred ninety three
07:54
million dollars is what they made from
07:56
live services and that does include like
07:59
that does include you know DLC purchases
08:01
or whatever from let you know whatever
08:03
games but it's the bulk of this is
08:05
actually Ultimate Team for their sports
08:07
products that's where they're making
08:08
this money it's nearly a billion dollars
08:11
then you've got your mobile stuff
08:12
underneath one hundred and thirty four
08:13
million but which games grow full game
08:16
downloads is only sixty percent of their
08:18
revenue in that last corner it just
08:19
shows you how important
08:21
ultimate in businesses look here's a
08:24
deal right that's a ridiculous sum of
08:26
money it's all microtransactions and
08:28
it's never gonna change because sports
08:30
fans don't really care about quality
08:32
yeah we see the the Metacritic score and
08:34
you know it's like yeah cool they
08:36
they're people are outraged whatever
08:37
else but if you look at the sales for
08:40
FIFA and mad and fee for a particular
08:41
FIFA is every single month the
08:43
top-selling game in Europe every month
08:45
like go and look at the UK sales charts
08:47
like five months running its FIFA across
08:49
small platforms it doesn't matter how
08:51
much garbage eh putting out in the
08:53
market in terms of sports products or
08:54
how much they monetize it casual gamers
08:56
will still lap it up and EA knows that
08:59
now as I give I mean I think they've
09:00
known that since the dawn of time what
09:01
you don't mean like I feel like that's
09:04
why we don't really even cover the whole
09:06
what I never got over there are moments
09:07
we've covered FIFA stuff when it's
09:09
particularly egregious but really we're
09:11
like what's the point
09:12
it's a duty to market that doesn't
09:14
really listen you know and I know that
09:15
you know some people it's stereotyping
09:18
that you know you play Cod in FIFA but
09:20
there is a market out there so true that
09:22
that's the reality of some people they
09:24
don't really care about the ins and outs
09:26
of what's going on in the gaming
09:27
industry they just want to buy the
09:28
latest one it has you know twenty twenty
09:31
on it they just want to play with em
09:32
mate right that's all well and good but
09:34
it has consequences of course for the
09:36
gaming industry in general because these
09:38
companies make so much money and then
09:40
they try and leak it into hardcore games
09:42
which EA has done and they failed doing
09:44
yeah so look I think you can kind of
09:46
summarize this is saying on the core
09:47
gaming side of EA's business they've
09:49
made strides and they've made
09:50
improvements and they're putting out
09:51
better quality product because they know
09:53
qual gamers will like make a lot of
09:55
noise you upgrade a lot of problems if
09:57
you don't right but casual gamers don't
09:59
know any better
10:00
and EA have no interest in improving
10:01
quality or improving monetization and so
10:03
EA seems like kind of a split business
10:05
now before they had the objective of
10:07
taking the Ultimate Team product and
10:09
shoving it into their core goals like
10:11
Star Wars like they want to do it with
10:13
battlefield they want to do it all sorts
10:14
of things even Need for Speed when they
10:16
did that they did that levy speed as
10:17
well
10:18
Mass Effect lots of games right but
10:20
they've given up on that now they know
10:21
that gamers will push back on that too
10:22
hard and so they're just focusing on
10:24
their sports products for their bullshit
10:25
and the core gaming side they're like
10:27
let's actually make good game yeah I
10:28
think that's sad for sports fans
10:31
it's never going to change though man I
10:32
mean it looks like I think it is a bit I
10:34
mean it's an elliot a result okay it is
10:37
a for now if that is where we're at I'm
10:40
much happier with the idea of we've
10:42
pushed back as a Kim I'm so proud of the
10:44
community in the last three or four
10:46
years we've got to this stage be great
10:48
if we can continue moving but it's also
10:50
kind of good to know that you know in
10:51
the future people can be a bit more
10:53
excited and it's still a about some of
10:56
the games that are going to be coming
10:58
out in EA that's true you know I mean I
11:00
do agree that in fact that's a good
11:01
segue into the switch section said hey
11:04
we all have aspirations so here's the
11:06
deal with the switch EA has not liked
11:08
the switch up to this point they've only
11:09
released three games on there they've
11:11
got a version of FIFA they've got
11:12
unravel and be like they're two little
11:15
indie games they published they don't
11:17
give a shit about switch up to this
11:18
point they've been waiting to see how it
11:19
goes switch has now sold fifty-two
11:21
million units it's a very assemblage it
11:23
was only 30 million like a few months
11:25
ago horrendous crazy it's great that EA
11:28
now paying attention here's what they
11:29
had to say about switch and whether or
11:31
not EA games are coming to it we're very
11:33
pleased with how well Nintendo has done
11:34
with switch I mean people love the
11:36
platform they enjoy it it's great eh
11:38
chief operating officer and chief
11:40
financial officer Blake Jorgensen
11:42
explained on the company's q3 2013
11:44
earnings call and remember there are a
11:45
lot of people that have both the Xbox
11:47
one and a switch or a PlayStation 4 and
11:49
a switch because it in many ways
11:51
provides a different experience
11:52
particularly a way to access great
11:54
Nintendo software we are always looking
11:56
and discussing with Nintendo what else
11:58
we can put on the platform and as you
12:00
can imagine as the platform grows our
12:01
interest in adding content grows for
12:04
that platform but we're also conscious
12:06
to the fact that top-selling titles by a
12:08
longshot
12:09
are all a Nintendo software which is
12:11
fabulous software but it helps us
12:13
balance sort of the realities of how big
12:16
our markets can be there but trust that
12:18
we're looking into it so what is
12:19
essentially saying here is that like yes
12:21
the switch sells a lot of stuff but the
12:23
reality is people buy the switch to plan
12:24
in Tendo games not to play other games
12:28
there is a huge aspect of on buying a
12:31
switch to step into the Nintendo Marva
12:33
shelf but more and more there is a you
12:35
know the the mood is changing that you
12:37
buy a switch for other games
12:38
yeah totally so don't quite agree with
12:40
that but look you know ei they have
12:42
their own numbers whatever look should
12:44
we get jealous more than order on the
12:45
switch yeah I would love to do that I
12:47
think the real question becomes the
12:48
future titles and this is what we can
12:50
start talking about what they said about
12:51
their future releases so e 8 launched
12:54
seven titles in 2019 now the next
12:56
financial year they actually plan to
12:59
launch a total of 14 games it's a lot
13:01
they're gonna have four sports games
13:03
FIFA Madden NFL and either UFC or NBA
13:07
Live four of the games are from their
13:09
existing IP so we're gonna have Cabana
13:11
Coco remaster which we've already heard
13:12
about we're gonna have middle of one of
13:14
VR game which you've already heard about
13:15
and then there's gonna be at least two
13:17
more games developed by either motive by
13:20
dice Bioware or criterion I think we can
13:22
count by aware out of that list because
13:24
you know we know their games are quite
13:26
far off and you masturbate in your
13:27
dragon age that's not going to be the
13:29
next 12 months we know that there are
13:30
two mobile titles coming as well and the
13:32
remaining four games will be from
13:34
smaller external devs so maybe like
13:36
their EA indie program that they have
13:38
okay so all of this is what yoga soon
13:40
described on the call as a broad-based
13:43
model intended to keep the publisher
13:44
from relying on any one title decreasing
13:47
the risk if one of the game's sells
13:49
below expectations or if say your
13:51
company goes through some massive drama
13:53
and explodes again like it was
13:54
Battlefront 2 so you're not over blames
13:56
go out they have other games I mean this
13:58
is the prom with Activision like they
13:59
really don't have more than likely don't
14:01
call the Judi yeah you know well I've
14:03
said this before they've also got Guitar
14:05
Hero okay it's coming back I promise
14:07
they should bring it back but anyway he
14:08
also had some comments about next-gen es
14:11
CFO Blake Jorgensen was quite vocal
14:13
about the possibilities that could open
14:15
up once next-gen consoles finally make
14:17
their way into the world saying the
14:19
power of the new consoles is going to be
14:21
substantially greater than the existing
14:23
consoles not only that but yo Genson
14:25
thinks that the things both next-gen
14:27
consoles can do will generally surprise
14:29
gamers we can do a lot more with PS 5
14:31
and Xbox Series X he added things we're
14:34
doing will blow people's minds so
14:36
clearly the Xbox Series X and PS 5 are
14:38
going to be stronger than their
14:39
predecessors but that already seems like
14:42
a given and the significance of yogurts
14:44
and statement comes from the implication
14:45
that the technology leap between current
14:47
and next gen consoles is going to be
14:49
bigger than X
14:50
which we kind of know already because
14:51
you know let the whole cpu thing hold
14:54
it's a state thing like I'm sure there's
14:55
some other things they don't even know
14:56
about yet so that's great news
14:58
the only thing we know is confirmed for
14:59
next-gen consoles for EA is the next
15:02
battlefield game battlefield 6 is
15:04
definitely gonna be launching there'll
15:06
be some good means in that surely oh
15:07
yeah every other battlefield launch is
15:09
anything to go by I think overall I
15:11
think EA is a very interesting company
15:12
at this point right because they really
15:14
have two business models operating
15:17
simultaneously side by side that are
15:19
very different we have a core gaming
15:20
business that's actually putting out
15:22
pretty decent games and then you have a
15:24
sports business which is a complete
15:26
ripoff putting out garbage and just
15:28
basically like just just just scamming
15:31
people and built on loot boxes endlessly
15:33
with no signs of change and that is
15:35
actually where the majority of EA's
15:37
money is coming from like that's that's
15:39
the reality palace yet what yeah
15:40
so look I again I like the fact that
15:43
they haven't they've cleaned up the core
15:45
gaming side of their business I wish
15:46
they would do the same thing to sports
15:47
kids I remember when I used to play
15:49
sports games right now we used to play
15:50
them one weekend are we used to play we
15:52
split matter yes and now there's no
15:54
where's games whatever pole no way oh I
15:57
remember NFL Blitz 2000 or whatever it's
15:59
called the one on Dreamcast anyway yeah
16:01
though there were sports cancer we did
16:02
love and the brother rugby mm great game
16:05
that was actually a great guy but look
16:07
it is good to see that they're doing
16:09
some some you know good stuff in the
16:10
single-player front and a hardcore game
16:12
front but look they're still very in my
16:15
opinion at risk all it takes is you know
16:17
some sort of domino effect with with
16:20
governments just start banning this shit
16:22
and they've lost what 90% of their
16:24
revenue yeah absolutely round as a
16:26
company they would immediately topple if
16:27
loot boxes were banned
16:29
I can't who knows what they would do I
16:31
can't think of a more risky company
16:32
apart from like I even Activision sure
16:35
that bit load on the IPE but they got
16:37
Blizzard like you know they're kind of
16:38
gonna be okay but he a it's all reliant
16:41
on the government's playing ball with
16:42
them which is a pretty risky thing but
16:44
anyway with Sam's comment about blizzard
